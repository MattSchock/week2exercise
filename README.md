Let's play a game. The game will consist of 100 turns. If the number of turns is even, you gain 5 points. If it's odd, you gain 3 points. If ever your score is equal to 125, you are reset back to 25 points. This will only be allowed to happen once. The game ends if you are able to make it through 100 turns or you reach more than 290 points, whichever comes first.
